UNIX is an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s, and has been under constant development ever since by operating system, we have to mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi user, multi tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops. UNIX systems also have a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to Microsoft Windows we provides an easy to use environment. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations which are not covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no windows interface available, for example, in a telnet session. Types of UNIX operating system There are many different versions of UNIX operating system, although they share common similarities. The most popular varieties of UNIX operating systems are Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X. Here within the faculty, we have a tendency to use Solaris on our servers and workstations, and hat UNIX system on the servers and desktop PCs.The kernel of UNIX operating system is that the hub of the operating system it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the file store and communications in response to system calls.As AN illustration of the means that the shell and therefore the kernel work along, suppose a user varieties rm my file which has the impact of removing the file my file. The shell searches the file store for the file containing the program rm, and so requests the kernel, through system calls, to execute the program rm on my file. Once the method rm my file has finished running, the shell then returns the UNIX operating system kiosk to the user, indicating that it's awaiting more commands. The shell acts as interface between the user and therefore the kernel. Once a user logs in, the login program checks the username and secret, and so starts another program referred to as the shell. The shell could be a statement interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user varieties in and arranges for them to be applied. The commands square measure themselves programs: after they terminate, the shell provides the user another prompt. The adept user will customize his/her own shell, and users will use totally different shells on identical machine. Workers and students within the faculty have the tcsh shell by default. The tcsh shell has sure options to assist the user inputting commands.
